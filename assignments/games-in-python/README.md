# 📘 Assignment: Games in Python – Hangman

## 🎯 Objective
Create a classic Hangman game in Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Set Up the Game

#### Description
Write a Python program that sets up the Hangman game. Define a list of possible words and select one at random for the player to guess.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define a list of at least 5 possible words
- Randomly select one word for the game
- Display a welcome message and instructions

### 🛠️ Implement the Game Loop

Create the main game loop that allows the player to guess letters, tracks their progress, and ends the game with a win or lose message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Accept letter guesses from the player
- Show the current progress (e.g., _ _ a _ _)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining

```
Welcome to Hangman!
Word: _ _ _ _ _
Guesses left: 6
Guess a letter: a
Word: _ a _ _ _
Guesses left: 6
...etc...
