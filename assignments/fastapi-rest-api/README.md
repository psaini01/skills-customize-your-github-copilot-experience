# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test a simple REST API using the FastAPI framework in Python. Practice designing endpoints, handling requests, and returning JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new Python project with FastAPI. Install the required packages and create a basic FastAPI application.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a new Python file (e.g., main.py) with a FastAPI app
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn (for running the server)
- Add a root endpoint ("/") that returns a welcome message as JSON


### 🛠️ Implement REST Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to your FastAPI app to manage a list of items (e.g., books, tasks, or users). Implement GET and POST methods.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Add a GET endpoint (e.g., /items) that returns a list of items as JSON
- Add a POST endpoint (e.g., /items) that accepts a new item in the request body and adds it to the list
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses for each endpoint
